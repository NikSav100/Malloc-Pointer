# Dynamic Array Manager in C

This project implements a dynamic array in C with the following functionalities:

 - Loading an array with random integers within a specified range.

 - Sorting the array using a bubble sort algorithm.

 - Searching for a user-specified element.

 - Deleting the found element and dynamically resizing the array.

 - Displaying the array contents.

The program uses pointers and dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free) to efficiently manage the array size and content.
